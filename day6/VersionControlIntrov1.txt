VERSION CONTROL

# A same project in production can have multiple versions. These versions are maintained using a version
control system

IF there was no version control, then code sharing would have been difficult. It could be done either sharing from google drive or pen-drive which not efficient.

So we need version control sustem for two major reasons:
    1.For code collaboration
    2.For version maintenance

There several version control systems like git, mercurial,etc. Git is among the most famous ones

Cloud platform
The code written in your local system should be kept somewhere in the cloud for the safety purpose.
We can again keep our code to google-drive or some other could storage. But, they don't understand VCS.

So, we keep our code in such cloud platform which understand VCS.For example: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket,etc.

In this session we use git and github.
